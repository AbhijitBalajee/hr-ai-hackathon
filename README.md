================================================================================

ISSUE: Backend won't start
SOLUTION: 
  â€¢ Check Python version (3.8+): python --version
  â€¢ Verify all dependencies installed: pip list
  â€¢ Check .env file exists in backend folder
  â€¢ Verify .env has no quotes around values

ISSUE: API key error / 401 Unauthorized
SOLUTION:
  â€¢ Verify AZURE_OPENAI_KEY in .env is correct (32 chars)
  â€¢ Check key has no extra spaces or quotes
  â€¢ Confirm key is active in Azure Portal
  â€¢ Try the /api/debug endpoint to see key status

ISSUE: Frontend can't connect to backend
SOLUTION:
  â€¢ Verify backend is running (check terminal)
  â€¢ Check API_URL in index.html matches backend address
  â€¢ Disable browser CORS extensions
  â€¢ Clear browser cache

ISSUE: AI responses are empty or truncated
SOLUTION:
  â€¢ Check Azure OpenAI quota/limits
  â€¢ Verify API version is correct
  â€¢ Check for content filters blocking responses
  â€¢ Review backend terminal for detailed error logs

ISSUE: Resume upload not working
SOLUTION:
  â€¢ Ensure file is PDF, DOC, DOCX, or TXT
  â€¢ Check file size (< 10MB recommended)
  â€¢ Verify employee is selected first
  â€¢ Check browser console for errors

                            DEVELOPMENT NOTES
================================================================================

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
  â€¢ Never commit .env file to Git (add to .gitignore)
  â€¢ API keys should be kept secret
  â€¢ In production, use proper authentication/authorization
  â€¢ Forum posts should have moderation in production
  â€¢ Resume uploads should be scanned for security

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
  â€¢ AI calls cached for 5 minutes (add caching in production)
  â€¢ Skills taxonomy loaded once on startup
  â€¢ Frontend uses vanilla JS for minimal overhead
  â€¢ Consider CDN for production deployment

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
  â€¢ Resume parsing returns mock data (needs AI integration)
  â€¢ Forum data not persisted (needs database)
  â€¢ No user authentication (uses employee selector)
  â€¢ Limited to 5 sample employees
  â€¢ AI responses depend on Azure OpenAI availability
  â€¢ Sample opportunities in SkillsMatch are hardcoded

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
  â€¢ Real resume parsing with OCR and NLP
  â€¢ Database integration (PostgreSQL)
  â€¢ User authentication and session management
  â€¢ Email notifications for forum replies
  â€¢ Calendar integration for learning schedules
  â€¢ Manager dashboard for team oversight
  â€¢ Mobile app version
  â€¢ Integration with PSA's existing HR systems
  â€¢ Advanced analytics and reporting
  â€¢ Multi-language support
  â€¢ Expand employee profiles dataset
  â€¢ Dynamic opportunity matching from real job postings
